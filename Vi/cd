cd
~
The cd command is used to change the current directory in Linux or other Unix-based operating systems.

cd's syntax is:
  cd [option] [directory]

For example, one can change the current directory, regardless of where it is on the system to the root directory by a forward slash:
  cd /
  
Also, the following would change the current directory, regardless of its location, to the /usr/sbin:
  cd /usr/sbin
 
Furthermore, if a user currently in the directory /usr/local/share/man/ desired to change to the directory /usr/local/share/man/man2,
they could input:
  cd /usr/local/share/man/man2
  
But one can also use the relative pathname to create a much shorter syntax to reach the same destintion:
  cd man2
