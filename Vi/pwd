pwd

~
pwd stands for Print Working Directory. It prints the path of the working directory.
The pwd command has two flags:
  pwd -L: Prints the symbolic path.
  pwd -P: Prints the actual path.
  
The default behavior of Built-in pwd is same as pwd -L, and the default behavior of /bin/pwd is same as pwd -P.
