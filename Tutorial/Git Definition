#create Git Definition 

First and foremost, Git is how programmers share and collaborate on code and is integral in the work force for all things tech related. Being unfamiliar with Git says to your possible future employer that you do not care about the technological advancements over the course of the last two decades. 

Git was created by Linus Torvalds to address one issue; all current source code management utilities required constant connection to a central computer to collaborate on code. Linus fixed this by allowing users to upload code that could be downloaded, worked on, then re-uploaded to the same central computer with a detailed note of what changed AND could be reverted to any previous version starting at the first commit. Pretty cool huh?
